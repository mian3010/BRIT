\section{Information}
Information have always been an important part of our lives. The accessibility has drastically changed, and so has the hunt for information. Today we see a lot of companies harvesting information in exchange for free (or paid) services easing the users everyday life.\\

This paper will focus on the exchange of information, and the tasks, devices and services we use to facilitate this exchange. Manual tasks eg. cycling to a specific location without using any technological devices, is not part of the scope. If the person cycling is using a smartphone to track the route, or provide directions then it is within scope.\\

This section has been split up into two parts. One explaining how we use information in our daily life, and another one explaining how we share this information to 3rd parties.
