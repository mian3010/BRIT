\section{Analysis}
A lot of our daily interaction with technology has to do with the exchange of information. Some of the regular daily tasks we perform are relatively new (introduced within the last 10 years). Some of the tasks of our daily life that this paper is focusing on are the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{Navigating to a location}
  \item{Vocal communication}
  \item{Textual communication}
  \item{Checking the social networks}
  \item{Otherwise tracking your behavior for own good}
\end{itemize}

All of the above tasks can be performed on a smartphone, but can also be performed on other technological devices.

We have come to trust the information our devices provide us, and for the companies to not misuse the information we send them. Often we are not even aware of how much the companies track about us. The following sections this paper will try to use the described theories in the previous sections to analyze upon the companies use of information and the effect on the society.
